% ileak: HH leak current
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Parameters
g_l=1;    % mS/cm^2
E_l=[-67];                        % E_l mean
E_l_std = [0];                    % E_l standard deviation. No noise by default.

% Functions
E_l_randomized = E_l + unifrnd(-E_l_std,E_l_std,1,Npop); % mV
Ileak(IN) = g_l.*(IN-E_l_randomized)

% Interface
@current += -Ileak(IN)
